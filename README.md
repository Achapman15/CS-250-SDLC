How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Understanding what users need usually starts by analyzing the system. This means getting feedback from the team and talking to previous users about any problems or changes they think should be made in the code. 
It's also essential to figure out what inputs and outputs are involved. Using user stories can be helpful because they let users share what they want and need. By looking at these stories, we can better understand what the end users are thinking.
